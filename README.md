# Verdant

*An open-source game launcher primarily for Naver Channeling Korean Maplestory players. (more games maybe in the future...)*

*(오픈소스 메이플스토리 네이버 채널링 게임런처)*

*[looking for a GMS launcher without Nexon Launcher? Check my other project [Xenon](https://github.com/NexerqDev/Xenon) out!]*

## Usage
Pre-compiled downloads can be found [here](https://github.com/NexerqDev/Verdant/releases). ([프로그램 다운](https://github.com/NexerqDev/Verdant/releases))

All you have to do is login to your Naver account (OTP supported), and then you can select the game you wish to play (only MapleStory for now), change your Maple ID if you desire then launch the game!

Note that NGM must be installed, and obviously MapleStory must be too for this launcher to function properly! Other than that, enjoy!

## Disclaimer
By using this software, you agree that I (Nicholas Tay <nexerq@gmail.com>) and/or collborators am not responsible for any damages that may be caused using this software (account banned, computer went on fire, etc.). That being said, I have tried to the best of my ability to make the program as transparent as possible, and this realistically should not happen. I mean - I use this software to get in and out of my account all the time, so it should be just fine. Basically, all the details can be found in the `LICENSE` file as in the root of the source code repository. Anyways, enjoy and have fun!

A note for Nexon (넥슨): if you don't like this software, please contact me via email or Twitter instead of banning me or whatever, and I will happily get it resolved ASAP (take down the repo, whatever). Thank you!
