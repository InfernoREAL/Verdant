### Alternate Login Method
Since Naver's CAPTCHA as mentioned above is super hard to actually get right, I developed this quick way to login (you shouldn't need to login very often anyway, I hope...)

1. Make sure you are logged in to Naver in Chrome (only supported, other browsers haven't tested). When logging in, be sure to have **Stay Signed in ticked** so the session actually lasts!
1. Go to the Naver homepage (http://naver.com).
1. Press F12 to open the DevTools.
1. Go to the Application tab, open Cookies and go into the "www.naver.com" section.
1. **Highlight** all the cookies with your mouse, right click and hit copy. (see below for what it should look like, obviously without the massive censor)
1. Launch Verdant (close and reopen if already opened).
1. Verdant should automatically login using your browser's login session.
